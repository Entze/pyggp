# Welcome to pyggp

pyggp is a Python library equipped to run games defined
in [Game Description Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Description_Language), played by agents.

This project is a spiritual successor of [Strategy Game Engine](https://github.com/Entze/Strategy-Game-Engine) and
the [Stanford General Game Playing Project](http://ggp.stanford.edu).

Currently, the library is coupled to Python. In the future it will be possible to write agents in other languages.
