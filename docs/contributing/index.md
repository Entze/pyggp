# Contributing

In order to ensure a consistent codebase and overall quality, the contributing guide acts as a written down version of
the best practices and guidelines the pyggp project aims to follow. The goal is that becoming a contributor is easy, and
the existing contributors can reference this guide during development to inform their decisions.

Attention: This guide is under development.
